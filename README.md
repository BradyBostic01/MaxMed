This was a class project done at Arkansas Coding Academy. It contains the java files that make up the api and the html,
css, and javascript files for the web interface. It is built to access the DrugBank database using MariadbUtil. The database
is not included with this app and may be obtained from DrugBank.ca provided you register. The xml file they give you can be parsed
into a database using dbparser (https://github.com/Dainanahan/dbparser). The project was hosted on a tomcat server.
